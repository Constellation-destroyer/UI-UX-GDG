# Sprout Space (Plant Sensor App UI) - Project Overview
**Project Mentor:** [Khushie Leishangthem](https://github.com/Khushie134) (GDG UI/UX Circle Manager)

## Description
**Sprout Space** is a plant sensor app designed to help users *monitor the health and requirements* of their plants. It provides an *intuitive* and *user-friendly* interface for plant enthusiasts to track various parameters like humidity, water levels, and temperature. Additionally, the app features a **marketplace** where users can explore and purchase plants.

## Current Progress
The app’s UI currently includes the following screens:
- **Intro Screen:** Welcomes users to the app.
- **Home Page:** Displays a list of plants owned by the user and an “Explore” section for the marketplace.
- ** Side Navbar:** Provides navigation options like My Plants, Explore, Shopping Cart, and Settings.
- ** Plant Stats Page (Plant 2):** Offers detailed statistics for a specific plant, including health metrics.
- ** Marketplace Checkout Page:** Displays the shopping cart for purchasing plants from the marketplace.

## Examples for Contributors
To spark ideas and open up possibilities, here are a few examples of what contributors can create:
- **Full Plant Library Page:** A comprehensive view of all the user’s plants.
- **Marketplace Plant Page:** A complete list of all plants available for purchase.
- **Individual Marketplace Plant Pages:** Detailed pages for each plant, including descriptions, care requirements, and pricing.
- **Signup/Login Page:** To enable user authentication and profile management.
These are only examples to help contributors brainstorm. Feel free to expand on these or introduce entirely new features that enhance the user experience!

## Requirements for Contributors
To complete the project and improve its functionality, contributors are required to:
- **Create Additional Pages:**
  - Use the provided examples as inspiration, but you’re welcome to go beyond them and add more creative pages or features.
- **Enhance User Interaction:**
  - Add micro-interactions for buttons, icons, and other interactive elements.
  - Introduce carousels where appropriate, such as in the marketplace section.
- **Prototyping:**
  - Perform detailed prototyping for all added and pre-existing screens to ensure smooth navigation and functionality throughout the app.
- **Style Consistency:**
  - Use the color styles provided in the design file to ensure uniformity across the app.
  - Incorporate components and variants for reusable UI elements, making the design system modular and efficient.
- **Refine and Improve Existing Designs:**
  - Maintain the current style and branding while incorporating new features.
  - Contributors can tweak existing pages if they feel it enhances the user experience, as long as the overall theme remains intact.

## Guidelines
- Ensure all new additions align with the existing design language.
- Prioritize usability and maintain a clean, modern aesthetic.

This project is a great opportunity to explore UI/UX design, prototyping, and interaction design while contributing to an open-source app.
